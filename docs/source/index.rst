Blackbox streamlines high-fidelity aerodynamic data generation process to facilitate various 
surrogate modeling applications, reducing the time and complexity associated with 
setting up complex analysis chains. Blackbox currently supports airfoil data generation with CST and FFD 
parameterization, as well as wing data generation with FFD parameterization. Additionally, an aerostructural
module is in active development. Explore the respective sections for detailed information on airfoil and
wing data generation. Blackbox can also run on High-Performance Computing resources, refer that section for more details.
