Introduction
============

High fidelity sample generation requires creating a complex analysis chain
which is time consuming. Blackbox is aimed at easing this process of sample 
generation. **Right now, airfoil data generation with CST and FFD parameterization,
and wing data generation with FFD parameterization is available**, aerostructural 
module is under developement. Check the respective sections for more details.

**Note**: Blackbox can also run on High Performace Computing resources.
