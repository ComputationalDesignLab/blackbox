Introduction
============

High fidelity sample generation requires creating a complex analysis chain
which is time consuming. Blackbox is aimed at easing this process of sample 
generation. **Right now, only airfoil data generation with CST parameterization
is supported**. Check the :ref:`airfoil_cst_tutorial` tutorial for more details. 
Work is under progress on various other parameterization techniques and data generation 
for wing and  aero-structural cases.
